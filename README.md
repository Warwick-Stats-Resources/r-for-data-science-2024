# R for Data Science 2024

Welcome to the R for Data Science course for 2024!

This course is taking place as part of the University of Warwick's 2024 Spring Training Week, organised by the [SCRPT](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/).

This is a beginner's level course in R, assuming no prior knowledge. We'll introduce the R programming language and RStudio, a popular IDE (integrated development environment) in which to work. We'll cover data types and structures in the core of the R language. We'll also introduce the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org), a well-established set of packages designed for data science, and show how they can be used to import and wrangle data. We'll also introduce you to R's powerful graphics capabilities, for producing production quality plots and tables. Finally, we'll offer a brief introduction to [Quarto](https://quarto.org), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system, which allows the interweaving of code and text to create reproducible documents, presentations and more.
