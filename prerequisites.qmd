Please ensure that you have the latest versions of R and RStudio installed prior to the first session. Currently, that's R-4.3.3 and RStudio-2023.12.1. 

We also **strongly** recommend you install the development tools to avoid potential issues installing packages.

### Installing R

Download the pre-compiled binary for your OS from https://cloud.r-project.org/ and install. More specifically:

**For Windows**

Click "Download R for Windows", then "base", then "Download R-4.3.3 for Windows". This will download an `.exe` file; once downloaded, open to start the installation. 

**For Mac**

Click "Download R for macOS", then "R-4.3.3-arm64.pkg" (the first option) to download the installer for Macs with **Apple Silicon** chips or "R-4.3.3-x86_64.pkg" (the second option) to download the installer for Macs with **Intel** chips. Run the installer to complete installation.

**For Linux**

Click "Download R for Linux". Instructions on installing are given for Debian, Fedora, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both `r-base` and `r-base-dev`.

### Installing R Studio Desktop (Open Source Edition)

Downloads are available from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

Download the relevant installer either under the "Install RStudio" header or, scrolling down the page, from the 'All installers and Tarballs' section. Run the installer to complete installation.

**For Windows with no admin rights**

Download the `.zip` source archive under "Zip/Tarballs". Extract the files to a folder where you have write access, e.g. `C:\Users\username\RStudio`. In this folder, open the `bin` directory and find the RStudio program: it is named `rstudio.exe`, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for `rstudio`. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.

**For all other operating systems**

Download the relevant installer for your OS listed under "Installers for Supported Platforms". Run the installer to complete installation.
 
### Development Tools

Some additional tools may be required to compile R packages from source.

**For Windows with no admin rights**

Download the latest (recommended) Rtools installer, `Rtools.exe`, from 
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>. Run the installer keeping the 
default settings.

**For Windows with admin rights**

Download the latest Rtools installer, `Rtools.exe`, from 
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>. Run the installer making the 
following selections: keep the default settings for the installation location 
and components to install; check the box to add rtools to the system PATH.

**For Mac**

Install XCode. Either:

1.  Download and install XCode from the Mac AppStore: <http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12>
2.  Within XCode go to Preferences : Downloads and install the Command Line 
Tools

Or for a smaller download size:

1. Register as an Apple Developer (free) here: <https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/>
2. Download the Command Line Tools for XCode appropriate for the version of 
OS X you are running from here: <https://developer.apple.com/downloads/>

**For Linux**

If you installed `r-base-dev`, when installing R, you should have all you need 
to build packages from source. Otherwise return to the instructions for 
installing R for your distribution and follow the instructions there to install 
the additional tools.
